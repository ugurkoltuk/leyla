# leyla

A simple reversi implementation.

To build,

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make

This program is made just for fun. It is far from perfect in every aspect. It currently 
runs an AI that plays random moves, but the plan is to make it have a minmax tree and 
perhaps optimizing search with alpha-beta pruning or something like that.
